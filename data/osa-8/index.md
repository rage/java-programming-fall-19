The table of contents above lists the topics of the eighth part of the course. The eighth part has been designed to cover the eighth week of the course. You should reserve well above 10 hours for each part of the course, depending on previous experience with computers. If you've tried programming before, you might advance faster in the beginning.

Have fun!
