### I've got a problem with the TMC plugin

Make sure you've got the newest version of the TMC plugin by clicking `Help` -> `Check for Updates` on the top bar of Netbeans.

If you can't make it work, come to the workshops and we'll help you :)

### Netbeans freezes when the feedback window opens

This problem shouldn't be present in the newer version of the plugin. You can download it at `Help` -> `Check for updates` and following the instructions.

### I think one of the programming exercises has a bug

Please make sure the bug is not in your code. You may ask for help to spot a possible bug from one of the course's [support channels](/support-and-assistance). You can also test if there's an update to the exercise in NetBeans by selecting TMC --> Download or update exercises from NetBeans' navigation bar. If the problem still persists, please open a new discussion thread in the course's Moodle-forum where the course assistants can see what's wrong with the exercise and fix the issue.

### I found an error in the material

Please open a new discussion thread in the course's Moodle-forum regarding the error you found.

If you are able to fix the error yourself, for example if it's a typing error, you can open a pull request in the course material's Github repository: https://github.com/rage/java-programming-fall-19


### Doing the exercises and returning them is slow on macOS

Follow these instructions to fix the issue: https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/macos-verkkoongelma/.

If it doesn't help, try changing the proxy setting on Netbeans to "no proxy".

### The installer of Netbeans is not opening on macOS

Try clicking the installer with the right button of the mouse and then choose "Open".

### the tests of part are not working on my mac

Check these instructions: [macOS ohjeet](/macos-ohjeet)

### while running the tests, I get an error about JAVA_HOME

Follow these instructions: [https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/java_home_not_found/](https://materiaalit.github.io/tmc-asennus/java_home_not_found/).

### Netbeans or its installer doesn't open, or looks odd when opening

Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 installed. The environment used on this course doesn't work properly with newer versions of Java. If you have a problem with this, try removing the newer versions of Java on your computer, and then install "Netbeans with TMC" again.

### The buttons to run and to send to the server on Netbeans are gray

This usually indicates either passed deadline or wrong course being selected in `TMC` -> `Settings`.

### I want to apply for study right through the programming mooc. Is this the right course?

No, you cannot apply for the study right based on this course.

### Encountering 'Cannot run program "cmd"' when doing programming exercises

The issue is probably due to an error with very recent Java 8 JDK versions. See the [Installation guide](https://www.mooc.fi/en/installation/netbeans) for specifics and solutions.
